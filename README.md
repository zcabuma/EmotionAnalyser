There are three parts to our application:

- JavaScript - Links our Application to DialogFlow. It also helps in sending messages to and from the Messenger Bot. 
- ML (Machine Learning) - Tells us the sentiment of the message we input. 
- Integration - Connects the JavaScript and ML (Machine Learning). Allows messages to be sent to and from the Messenger Bot.
